# GreyWolfBot
GreyWolfBot is a basic Discord bot with which I am creating modules for.
---
# Run the bot
To run the bot use this command in a terminal window or script
```
java -jar GreyWolfBot.jar
```
* A config file will be generated on first boot for your token and other data
---
# Creating a bot account
You create your bots account over at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

To invite the bot to your server copy the clientID from the bots page and use it in this url
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=66186303
```
